      <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt
      <li>1/2 cup shorting</li>
      <li>3-1/2 tablespoons cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups cooked pumpkin</li>
      <li>12fl. ounces evaporated milk</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Prepare pie crust</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
      <li>Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time.</li>
      <li>Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold together.</li>
      <li>Shape the dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>From pie crust</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly
          floured board, roll dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness.</li>
      <li>With a sharp knife, cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than the upside-down
          8- to 9-inch pie pan.</li>
      <li>Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it
          right-side up onto the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom
          of the pie pan. Form a crust by folding the overhanging edges under
          and crimp as desired.</li>
