    <h3>Despription</h3>
    <p>This is a thick, rich soup with tons of flavor. Something I whipped up
       off the top of my head, with things I had on hand. Super easy, quick,
       and a great way to use squash. An instant hit at my house.</p>
       <h2>Ingredents</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
         <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
         <li>1 stalk of celery, chopped</li>
         <li>1 medium carrot, chopped</li>
         <li>2 medium potatoes, cubed</li>
         <li>1 medium butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cubed</li>
         <li>32 fl.oz chicken stock</li>
         <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Melt the butter in a large pot, and cook the onion, celery,
            carrot, potatoes, and squash 5 minutes, or until lightly browned.
            Pour in enough of the chicken stock to cover vegetables. Bring to
            a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer 40 minutes, or
            until all vegetables are tender.</li>
          <li>Transfer the soup to a blender, and blend until smooth. Return
            to pot, and mix in any remaining stock to attain desired
            consistency. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
